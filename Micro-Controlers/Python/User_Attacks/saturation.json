    {"group": 4, "intensity": 255, "duration_ms": 5000, "jitter_percent": 0}

  "repeat": 1,

  "power_consumption_watts": 24.0,
  "expected_result": "Entire sensor array saturates, producing pure white video. Effect lasts as long as IR is active. Immediate recovery when stopped.",
  "limitations": "Requires line-of-sight. Dome cameras with IR coating need closer range (2-3m). Ineffective on thermal cameras."
